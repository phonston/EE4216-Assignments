### 1. Starting the server

Make sure that the maven project can build successfully.

### 2. By default test database data is added

To disable this, simply remove "src/main/resources/data.sql"

Or if extra data needs to be pre-added simply modify it.

The schema is also located in the same directory as data.sql.
